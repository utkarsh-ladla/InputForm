## Usage

1. **Start the Application**: 
   - After cloning the repository and installing dependencies, start the development server by running:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - This will open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Adding Input Fields**:
   - Click the **Add Field** button to create a new input field. This allows you to customize the form based on your needs.

3. **Entering Data**:
   - Enter data into each input field as required. Each field can hold different values, depending on the information you want to collect.

4. **Removing Input Fields**:
   - If you need to remove an input field, click the **Remove** button next to the corresponding field. This will delete that field from the form, keeping your interface clean.

5. **Submitting the Form**:
   - Once you have filled out the desired input fields, click the **Submit** button. This action will log the values of all input fields to the console.
   - You can open the browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect") and navigate to the "Console" tab to view the logged values.

6. **Form Reset**:
   - After submission, you can add new fields or remove existing ones to start over or collect new data without refreshing the page.

### Example Usage Scenario:

- **Use Case**: A user needs to collect feedback from multiple participants in a workshop.
  - Start the app and click **Add Field** for each participant's feedback.
  - Enter the feedback in the respective input fields.
  - If any field is no longer needed, simply click **Remove**.
  - After entering all feedback, hit **Submit** to log the data.

### Note:

- For optimal results, ensure that the browser window is adequately sized to display the input fields comfortably.
