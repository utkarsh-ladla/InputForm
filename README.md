Design
The design of this form focuses on simplicity, modern aesthetics, and functionality:

Layout: The input fields are centered and aligned to provide a clean, structured interface. Additional input fields are added vertically, keeping a simple and intuitive format.
Color Scheme:
Primary Color: #0A75AD (Blue) is used for headers and interactive elements like buttons on hover.
Accent Color: #F2A365 (Orange) is used for buttons to draw attention and highlight interactions.
Text: White and dark blue are used to maintain contrast and readability.
Buttons:
Default button background is accent-colored (#F2A365).
On hover, the button background transitions to the primary color (#0A75AD) while swapping the border and accent colors.
Buttons feature smooth transitions to enhance user interaction.
